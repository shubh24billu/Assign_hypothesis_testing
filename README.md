ASSIGNMENT 3 Q-1_cutlet:-

    Null-Hypothesis. - H0 = no difference in diameter.
    Alternate-Hypothesis. - Ha = there is difference in diameter.

    In this the 2 sample t test is being done to compare mean between two samples .
    Outcome :-the p-value(0.47) is greater than significance level(0.05) so we accept the Null hypothesis. 



ASSIGNMENT 3 Q-2_LabTAT:-

    Null-Hypothesis. - H0 = no difference in average TAT among the different laboratories
    Alternate-Hypothesis. - Ha = there is difference in average TAT among the different laboratories

    Here comparison is more than 2 sample so we do anova test.
    Outcome :-the p-value(2.11*10^^-57 ~= 0) is less than significance level (0.05) so we accept the Alternate hypothesis. 



ASSIGNMENT 3 Q-3_BuyerRatio:-

    Null-Hypothesis. - H0 = male-female buyer ratio's are similar across regions.
    Alternate-Hypothesis. - Ha = male-female buyer ratio's are NOT similar across regions.

    Here we do Chi2 contingency independence test 
    Outcome :-The p-value(0.018) is less than significance level (0.05) so we accept the Alternate hypothesis. 



ASSIGNMENT 3 Q-4_CustomerOrderForm:-

     Null-Hypothesis. - H0 = customer order forms defective % does not varies by centre.
     Alternate-Hypothesis. - Ha = customer order forms defective % varies by centre.

     Outcome :-the p-value(0.27) is greater than significance level(0.05) so we accept the Null hypothesis.
